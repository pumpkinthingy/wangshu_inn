            <h1>Our Menu</h1>
            <div class="grid_layout">
                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Almond_Tofu_256x256.png" alt="Almond Tofu Image">
                    <h2 href="homepage.html">Almond Tofu</h2>
                    <p>A dessert made out of almond. It has a silky-smooth texture with a long-lasting aroma of almond. It's named tofu only because of its tofu-like shape.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Matsutake_Meat_Rolls_256x256.png" alt="Matsutake Meat Roll Image">
                    <h2>Matsutake Meat Rolls</h2>
                    <p>A pan-fried meat dish. Ground meat is put on the Matsutake and gently pan-fried on low heat so the Matsutake can fully take in the aromatic juice of the meat. It's a mouthwatering delicacy in all of its glory.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Noodles_with_Mountain_Delicacies_256x256.png" alt="Noodles Image">
                    <h2>Noodles with Mountain Delicacies</h2>
                    <p>Noodles in a meat-and-vegetable sauce. The sauce has a rustic flavor, and there's a generous amount of it mixed in with the noodles. A humble but enduringly popular dish.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Chicken-Mushroom_Skewer_256x256.png" alt="Chicken-Mushroom Skewer Image">
                    <h2>Chicken-Mushroom Skewer</h2>
                    <p>A skewer of mushrooms and poultry. All the best the wild has to offer are pierced on just one stick.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Vegetarian_Abalone_256x256.png" alt="Vegetarian Abalone Image">
                    <h2>Vegetarian Abalone</h2>
                    <p>A vegetarian dish with a rich flavor. The matsutake has been sliced thin and fried till golden before pouring the sauce.
                        The matsutake meat is sumptuous and has flavor to match that of fresh abalone â€” almost enough to make you think it was the real thing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Bamboo_Shoot_Soup_256x256.png" alt="Bamboo Shoot Soup">
                    <h2>Bamboo Shoot Soup</h2>
                    <p>A soup dish that's been stewed for a good long while. The meat and ham have been diced into small pieces, and the soup has been kept on low heat till it turned milky white.
                        The process has brought out the distinct flavors of both kinds of meat, making for an especially tasty soup.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Golden_Crab_256x256.png" alt="Verr Goldet">
                    <h2>Golden Crab</h2>
                    <p>A crab dish cooked in the ancient ways. The crab has been chopped into pieces and battered with flour, before being stir-fried till golden and rich with flavor.
                        It is worthy of the word "gold," whether in terms of appearance or quality.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <img src="Food%20Images/Item_Adeptus_Temptation_256x256.png" alt="Verr Goldet">
                    <h2>Adeptus Temptation</h2>
                    <p>A complex, famous type of Liyue cuisine, in which specially selected ingredients are submerged and slowly bowled into soup stock.
                        The recipe scribbled from memory alone was enough to urge the adepti to once again return to the world of men.</p>
